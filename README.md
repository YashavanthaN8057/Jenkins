Jenikins is all about jobs and we a job means the list of tasks to be executed.

Jenkins offers multiple types of jobs:
    1) Freestyle jobs ( Options of the jobs are created manually )
    2) Pipeline Jobs ( All the options are handled in the form of code) : Preferred and closed to GitOps Culture.
Jenkins run as a standalone server and cannot be operated as a CLUSTER. But we will diversify the jobs by running them on agents.

To run jobs on the top of a node/agent, agent should have java installed.
Demonstrate adding workStation as an agent to the controller.

To write a pipeline, fileName should suffixed with Jenkinsfile

Remembers, stages in jenkins are sequence in nature, STATE-1 will only be executed if the STAGE-1 is completed. But, we can achive parallel processing using PARALLEL Stages.
